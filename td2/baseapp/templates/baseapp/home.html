<h2 class="text-center">WTF?</h2>
<p>This is site is currently under development.  This means it is not safe for people or their furpals/lizardkin/insectbros and probably wont work <em>AT ALL!</em> </p>
<p>It is being developed for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To teach me django, python, bootstrap etc</li>
    <li>To test out some ideas I had about whether or not the <a href ="https://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3953574">Thunderdome</a> concept,
    currently running on the <a href="forums.somethingawful.com">Something Awful forums</a>, could be replicated/automated on another platform in the event something happened to those forums
    (this is, admittedly, less of a risk currently than it used to be, but who knows what the future holds?).</li>
    <li>To see how easy it is these days to make something with relatively modern tools and make it as accessible and <a href="https://securityheaders.com/?q=fumblemouse.pythonanywhere.com&hide=on&followRedirects=on">secure</a> as possible </li>
    <li>To make me incredibly rich by stealing other people's ideas and monetising them, as is the fashion (stretch goal).</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="text-center">How does it work?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Someone creates a contest</li>
<li>>While that contest is open, users can enter stories into it</li>
<li>Currently there is no scheduling (because this site is on a free hosting account), so the contest can be closed by a button on the <a href="{% url 'view current contests' %}"> Current Contests </a> page</li>
<li>All entrants are then assigned three stories to critique. Users can see stories they are in line to judge in <a href="{% url 'judgemode' %}"> Judgemode </a> </li>
<li>User/Judges critiques aren't final until they have submitted with the 'Final' checkbox xhecked, so they can take notes as they read each sotry</li>
<li>Once all the critiques are in (current state viewable in <a href="{% url 'view current contests' %}"> Current Contests </a>  another botton on that page closes the competition and shows the result.
Again, this would normally be automated by I am incredibibly cheap.</li>
